   <h1>MÃºsica Arcade</h1> 
<hr>
<p>A broken heart is all that's left
<br>I'm still fixing all the cracks
<br>Lost a couple of pieces when
<br>I carried it, carried it, carried it home
</p>
<p>I'm afraid of all I am
<br>My mind feels like a foreign land
<br>Silence ringing inside my head
<br>Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
</p>
<p>I've spent all of the love I saved
<br>We were always a losing game
<br>Small-town boy in a big arcade
<br>I got addicted to a losing game
</p>
<p>Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
<br>All I know, all I know
<br>Loving you is a losing game
</p>
<p>How many pennies in the slot?
<br>Giving us up didn't take a lot
<br>I saw the end 'fore it begun
<br>Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
</p>
<p>Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
<br>All I know, all I know
<br>Loving you is a losing game
</p>
<p>Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
<br>All I know, all I know
<br>Loving you is a losing game
</p>
<p>I don't need your games, game over
<br>Get me off this rollercoaster
</p>
<p>Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
<br>All I know, all I know
<br>Loving you is a losing game
</p>
<p>Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
<br>All I know, all I know
<br>Loving you is a losing game
</p>
